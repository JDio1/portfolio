# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements in the field of data engineering. Each project included here demonstrates my expertise in designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines, as well as my ability to leverage various technologies to solve real-world data challenges.


## Projects

### Project 1: [Expense Analysis Project](https://github.com/JDio1/expense-analysis-pipeline)
**Brief Overview:**  
The Expense Analysis Project is designed to provide a detailed examination of personal spending habits over the year 2023. Utilizing Python and powerful data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project automates the process of cleaning, processing, and visualizing raw expense data. By delivering insightful statistical analyses and compelling visualizations, this project helps individuals understand their spending patterns, identify unusual expenses, and make informed financial decisions. The result is a comprehensive tool for continuous financial monitoring and optimization.

**Technology Used:**  
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter

**Results:**  
The Expense Analysis Project transformed raw expense data into actionable insights. Key outcomes include:

- **Spending Insights**: Provided summary statistics and visual breakdowns of expenses by category.
- **Pattern Identification**: Revealed trends and variations in spending habits.
- **Outlier Detection**: Highlighted unusual spending activities.
- **Visualizations**: Created clear and informative charts and graphs.
- **Financial Insights**: Enabled better financial decisions and potential savings identification.

Overall, the project delivered a robust tool for effective personal finance management.

### Project 2: [Weather Data Pipeline](https://github.com/JDio1/GCP_Weather_Data_Pipeline)
**Brief Overview:**  
This project automates the collection, processing, and storage of weather data using Python and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. It fetches real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data, and stores it in Google Cloud Storage. The pipeline showcases modern data engineering practices, including API integration, cloud storage management, and efficient data handling using Python scripting.

**Technology Used:**  
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Services**: Google Cloud Storage
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API
- **Libraries**:
  - `google-cloud-storage`: Google Cloud Storage client library
  - `requests`: HTTP library for making API calls
  - `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `db-dtypes`: For handling database-specific data types in pandas

**Results:**  
This project successfully demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline for fetching, processing, and storing weather data. By integrating the OpenWeatherMap API with Google Cloud Platform services, the pipeline automates data collection and storage, making real-time weather information readily accessible for analysis and visualization. The project showcases effective use of Python scripting and cloud infrastructure to handle and manage data efficiently.
